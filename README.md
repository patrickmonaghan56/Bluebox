My final project for software engineering in 2019, My group and I did a mock up of the redbox database system that we called Blue box.
has several interactive GUIs for uploading movies, adding inventory for movies and bluray disks, a display screen similar to what redbox uses which 
displays "movie" cover photos, in this case stock imagery, and allows for several different types of searching, by title, by genre, by rating.
upon selection of a movie from the search menu there was a rental that was generated, and upon a hypothetical return (done through finding the most recent
rental of the inputted Movie ID) it completed the rental and generated a receipt for our database.
